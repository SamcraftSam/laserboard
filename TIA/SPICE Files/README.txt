This directory (Spice Files) contains three simulation-ready SPICE netlists.
These netlists contain the photodiode amplifier design generated by Photodiode 
Wizard, and the corresponding SPICE macromodels for the selected op amp(s). 
Also included is a suitable input signal, and appropriate analysis mode 
(.AC, .TRAN, .NOISE).

These netlists are text-based .cir files, and should be compatible with a wide
variety of SPICE simulators.  More information about text-based SPICE netlists
can be found at: http://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/ 

	- ACAnalysis.cir: Simulates AC response of the photodiode amplifier design. 
	                  Output of circuit can be plotted by probing V(OUT) 

	- TransientAnalysis.cir: Simulates the step response of the photodiode 
	                         amplifier design. Output of circuit can be plotted by 
	                         probing V(OUT) 

	- NoiseAnalysis.cir: Simulates the noise of the photodiode amplifier design. 
	                     Noise gain can be plotted by probing GAIN, or 
	                     V(ONOISE)/V(INOISE)
